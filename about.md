Hi, I'm Eli!

I study mathematics at Oregon State University, run a small venture making machine learning and computer vision algorithms to identify melanoma, and organize the university's Entrepreneurship Club.

I'm passionate about mathematics, machine learning, physics and entrepreneurship. I also have some passing interest in philosophy (especially buddhism) and economics.
