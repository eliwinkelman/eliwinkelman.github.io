Hi, I'm Eli!

I study mathematics at Oregon State University. I'm currently doing computational topology research at OSU.

In the past I've worked on various computer science and entrepreneurship [projects](/projects/ProjectsPage). The most exciting being [Melaknow](/projects/Melaknow). I occasionally do consulting work for interesting projects.
