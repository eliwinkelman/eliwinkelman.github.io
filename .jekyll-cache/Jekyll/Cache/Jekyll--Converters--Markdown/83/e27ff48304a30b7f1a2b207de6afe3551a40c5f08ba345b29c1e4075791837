I"Ì<p>An implementation of weak typing for C++11 and Arduino.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/foonathan">Foo Nathan</a> for inspiration on variant implementation from his typesafe library. The type tracking internals of this library are largely based on his implementation, with some modifications to make things run in C++11/Arduino and to properly override operators to create the operator behavior you would expect from the underlying type.</p>
