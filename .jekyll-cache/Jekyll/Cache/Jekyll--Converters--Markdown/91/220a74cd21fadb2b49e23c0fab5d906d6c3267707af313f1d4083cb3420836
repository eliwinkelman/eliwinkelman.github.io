I"b<p>This sudoku solver implements Donald Knuthâ€™s dancing links algorithm to solve sudoku puzzles quickly. Dancing links is an algorithm for solving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover">exact cover problems</a>, which include Sudoku and the N queens problem.</p>

<p>The implementation averaged about 1.5 ms on 15 high difficulty (human rated) sudoku puzzles I found online.</p>
