I"Ü<p>We can show that $S^n$ is path connected once we have the right groundwork:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Show that $S^n - {N}$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ through the stereographic project.</li>
  <li>Show that $\mathbb{R}^n$ is path connected.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then the proof follows by supposing that two distinct points in $S^n$ are not path connected. We can pick another distinct point, $N$, and remove it from the space, creating a space $S^n - {N}$ which is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$ and therefore must be path connected. So there must exist a path between our two distinct points.</p>

<h3 id="path-connectedness">Path Connectedness</h3>

<p>Definition: A path in a topological space $X$ between points $p, q \in X$ is a continuous function $\gamma : [0, 1] \rightarrow X$ such that $\gamma(0) = p$ and $\gamma(1) = q$.</p>

<p>Definition: A topological space $X$ is path connected if for any two points $p, q \in X$ there is a path $\gamma$ between them.</p>

<h3 id="the-stereographic-projection">The Stereographic Projection</h3>

<p>The stereographic projection is a projection of the n-sphere onto $\mathbb R^{n-1}$.</p>

<p>Pick a north pole $N$ of $S^n \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$. Then the projection of the point $Q \in S^n-{N}$ onto the hyperplane $H \subset \mathbb R^{n}$ is the intersection of $\overline{NQ}$ with $H$.</p>

<p>In Cartesian Coordinates this is given by</p>

\[P_i = \frac{p_i}{1-p_0}\]

<p>where here $N=(1, 0, 0 â€¦ 0)$, $(p_0, p_1, â€¦ p_n)$ are the coordinates of the point on the n-sphere and $(P_0, P_1, â€¦ P_n)$ are the points on the projected hyperplane.</p>

<p>This function is continuous, and it has a continuous inverse.</p>

<p>Therefore, this definies a homeomorphism between $S^n - {N}$ and $\mathbb R^{n-1}$ Note that the choice of the point $N$ is arbitrary.</p>

<h3 id="path-connectedness-of-mathbbrn">Path Connectedness of $\mathbb{R^n}$</h3>

<p>Theorem: If $X, Y$ are path connected, then so is $X \times Y$.</p>

<p>Proof: Let $p, q \in X \times Y$ be points. Then $p = (x_1, y_1)$ and $q = (x_2, y_2)$. Since $X$ is path connected, there is a path $\gamma_1$ from $x_1$ to $x_2$. Similarly, there is a path $\gamma_2$ between $y_1$ and $y_2$. Therefore $\gamma = (\gamma_1, \gamma_2)$ is a path in $X \times Y$ between $p$ and $q$. $\square$</p>

<p>Theorem: $\mathbb{R}$ is path connected.</p>

<p>Proof: Let $p, q \in \mathbb{R}$ be distinct points. Then $p = (x_1, y_1)$ and $q = (x_2, y_2)$. Observe that the function 
\(\gamma(t) = (
\frac{1}{x_2-x_1}(t+x_1), \frac{1}{y_2-y_1}(t+y_1))\) 
is a path between $p$ and $q$. $\square$</p>

<h3 id="path-connectedness-of-sn">Path Connectedness of $S^n$</h3>

<p>Theorem: $S^n$ is path connected for $n \geq 1$.</p>

<p>Proof: Let $p, q \in S^n$ be distinct points and suppose they are not path connected. Then let $N$ be a third distinct point in $S^n$. $S^n - {N}$ is homeomorphic to $R^{n-1}$ and therefore path connected, so there must be a path from $p$ to $q$. Thus $S^n$ is path connected.</p>
