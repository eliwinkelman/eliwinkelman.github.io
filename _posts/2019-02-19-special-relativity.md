title: An introduction to special relativity
published: false
---

A few years ago I found that there is a dirth of good introductory writing on special relativity that is both understandable to novices but still targeted above the casual lay person. In other words, both heavily motivated by conceptuals and rigorous.

I read "Why does E=mc^2?" by Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw, which was quite good conceptually but didn't build up any mathematical framework. On the other side of the spectrum, a copy of "A Stubborny Persistant Illusion", a collection of Einstein's greatest works, sitting around my house. This was much more difficult to parse but it also lead to more mathematical/rigorous aha! moments.

I've been working through a variety of other sources
