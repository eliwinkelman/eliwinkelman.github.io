A few years ago I found that there is a dirth of good introductory writing on special relativity that is both understandable to novices but still targeted above the casual lay person. In other words, both heavily motivated by conceptuals and rigorous.

I read "Why does E=mc^2?" by Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw, which was good conceptually but didn't build up any mathematical framework. On the other side of the spectrum, a copy of "A Stubborny Persistant Illusion", a collection of Einstein's greatest works, was sitting around my house. This book, (or specifically, "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies") was difficult to parse but it also lead to actual mathematical/rigorous aha! moments.

I worked through a variety of different sources on special relativity (blog posts, lecture notes, textbooks) and came to what I thought was a satisfactory understanding of the theory. As I developed my own understanding I wrote a set of notes that are meant to serve as the introduction that I couldn't find. It mostly follows logically from axioms while still attempting to providing more motivation than most lecture notes.

I'll be posting a link to the first section of the notes here once I finish editing and organizing them.
