title: The Trouble with Buoyancy in an Elevator
published: false
---

The following problem was a conceptual question in one of my physics classes. It has a simple correct solution, but it also a has a simple incorrect solution. Finding the mistake is revealing.

A jar of water sits in an elevator with an apple floating (statically) on its surface. When the elevator accelerates upwards, does the apple sink, rise, or stay at the same height relative to the water?

We can imagine a sketch of the initial (static) situation like this:

(Sketch initial system)

There are only two forces on the apple, gravity and buoyancy. We know the apple is in equilibrium so **Fg = Fb**.

Once the elevator starts moving, we don't get any new forces (on the ball), but the glass is accelerating upwards.

I propose two solution methods: calling on the equivalence principle or working out the free body diagrams of the ball and the jar.

The first method is much quicker so we'll explore that direction first. The equivalence principle states that a system with no internal forces accelerating upwards with acceleration **a** is indistinguishable from a stationary system with a gravitational force **Fg=ma** downwards.

This means that our accelerating elevator can be examined as a stationary elevator where our new gravitational acceleration **new gravitational acceleration = g + a**.

How does this effect our two forces on the apple?

**Fg = mg** becomes **Fg = m(g+a)**
