Decreasing costs for solar panel installations, government subsidies, and innovative financing has turned home solar power installations into a simple, green, and lucrative investment. 

Unfortunately, this only applies to people who own their homes, excluding 43 million people from solar power in the Unites States. At rental homes, a landlord owns the building but typically does not pay the electricity bill. If they installed solar, landlords would be taking on the financial burden of the installation without seeing any of the electricity savings. And while tenants would benefit financially, they don't have the option of a moveable or temporary installation.

Helios is an incentive platform for landlords and tenants to install solar power.
